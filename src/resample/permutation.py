"""
Permutation-based tests.

A collection of statistical tests that use permutated samples. Permutations are used to
compute the distribution of a test statistic under some null hypothesis to obtain
p-values without relying on approximate asymptotic formulas.

The permutation method is generic, it can be used with any test statistic, therefore we
also provide a generic test function that accepts a user-defined function to compute the
test statistic and then automatically computes the p-value for that statistic. The other
tests internally also call this generic test function.

All tests return a TestResult object, which mimics the interface of the result
objects returned by tests in scipy.stats, but has a third field to return the
estimated distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis.

    Test independence of two discrete data sets with the U-statistic.

    The USP test is described in this paper: https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2021.0549.
    According to the paper, it outperforms the Pearson's χ² and the G-test in both
    in stability and power.

    It requires that the input is a contigency table (a 2D histogram of value pairs).
    Whether the original values were discrete or continuous does not matter for the
    test. In case of continuous values, using a large number bins is safe, since the
    test is not negatively affected by bins with zero entries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    w : array-like
        Two-dimensional array which represents the counts in a histogram. The counts
        can be of floating point type, but must have integral values.
    size : int, optional
        Number of permutations. Default 9999.
    method : str, optional
        Method used to generate random tables under the null hypothesis.
        'auto': Uses a heuristic to select the fastest algorithm for the given table.
        'shuffle': A shuffling algorithm, which requires extra space to store N + 1
        integers for N entries in total and has O(N) time complexity. It performs
        poorly when N is large, but does not depend on the number of K table cells.
        'patefield': Patefield's algorithm, which does not require extra space and
        has O(K log(N)) time complexity. It performs well even if N is huge. For
        small N and large K, the shuffling algorithm is faster.
        Default is 'auto'.
    random_state : numpy.random.Generator or int, optional
        Random number generator instance. If an integer is passed, seed the numpy
        default generator with it. Default is to use ``numpy.random.default_rng()``.

    Compute p-value for null hypothesis that samples are drawn from the same population.

    The computation is based on a user-defined test statistic. The distribution of the
    test statistic under the null hypothesis is generated by generating random
    permutations of the inputs, to simulate that they are actually drawn from the same
    population. The test statistic is recomputed on these permutations and the p-value
    is computed as the fraction of these resampled test statistics which are larger
    than the original value.

    Some test statistics need to be transformed to fulfill the condition above, for
    example if they are signed. A transform can be passed to this function for those
    cases.
